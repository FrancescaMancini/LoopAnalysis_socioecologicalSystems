# LoopAnalysis_socioecologicalSystems
Qualitative modeling of socioecological systems using Loop Analysis.

The system can be described by variables and qualitative links between these variables. These links can be entered into a matrix.
Qualitative stability criteria, the Routh-Hurwitz criteria, are used to test stability of the system to pulse perturbations.

The adjoint of the system matrix also provides predictions of the reponses of the variables to press perturbations.
